# 📘 Assignment: Practice React Props

In this assignment, we will create a small React project to practice how props work.

What are Props?
⚡ Props (_short for properties_) allow us to pass data from one component to another and make our components reusable.

📝 Task

1. 🛠️ Create a new React app using create-react-app or Vite.
2. 🧩 Create at least 3 reusable components (for example: `Card`, `Button`, `UserProfile`).
3. 📥 Use props to pass data into these components. Examples:

   - 👤 Pass a user’s name and age to a `UserProfile` component.
   - 🔘 Pass text and color to a `Button` component.
   - 📄 Pass title and description to a `Card` component.

4. 🎨 Display at least 3 different variations of each component by changing props.
5. 💅 Add some simple CSS for better UI.

✅ Requirements

- 📌 Your project should have at least 3 components using props.
- 🧹 Code must be clean and readable.
- 🌐 Push your project to GitHub and share the repo link.

# 📖 Solution: Project Description – Props Practice in React

🎯 Objective

The goal of this assignment was to practice using props in React by creating reusable components. Props allow us to pass data from one component to another, making our components dynamic and reusable.

🛠️ Steps I Followed

1. Created a New React Project

I used Vite (faster and modern alternative to Create React App) to set up the React environment:

npm create vite@latest props-practice
cd props-practice
npm install
npm run dev

This gave me a fresh React project running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.

2. Created Reusable Components

Inside the `src/components/` folder, I created three components:

a:) Button.jsx

- Props: `text`, `color`
- Displays a styled button with customizable text and background color.

b:) UserProfile.jsx

- Props: `name`, `age`, `hobby`
- Displays user details inside a card-like box.

c:) Card.jsx

- Props: `title`, `description`
- Displays a content card with a title and description.

3. Used Props in App.jsx

In `App.jsx`, I imported the three components and displayed three different variations of each one by changing their props:

- Buttons: “Click Me” (blue), “Delete” (red), “Submit” (green)
- User Profiles: Atif (22, Coding), Usman (23, Movie Directing), Aroona (22, Writing)
- Cards: React Basics, Advanced React, Frontend Tools

This demonstrated how props make components reusable with different data.

4. Added Simple CSS

I styled each component using inline CSS for simplicity:

- Buttons have custom background colors and rounded corners.
- User profiles and cards have borders, padding, and spacing for a neat layout.

This made the UI cleaner and more readable.

5. Code Organization

- Components are kept in separate files for clean code.
- Props are passed in a simple, clear way to make the code easy to understand.
- Each component is reusable and independent.

# 🚀 Deploying Vite + React App to GitHub Pages

This guide explains how to deploy this project to GitHub Pages.

🔹 1. Install `gh-pages`

Inside your project, install the `gh-pages` package:

npm install gh-pages --save-dev

🔹 2. Configure `vite.config.js`

Edit your `vite.config.js` file and add the `base` option with your repo name:

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [react()],
base: "/ use your repo name here/",
});

🔹 3. Update `package.json` Scripts

In your `package.json`, add `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts:

"scripts": {
"dev": "vite",
"build": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview",
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}

👉 (Optional but recommended) Also add a `homepage` field:

"homepage": "https://easy2-code.github.io/Props-Practice-in-React"

Like this:

{
"name": "props-practice",
"private": true,
"version": "0.0.0",
"homepage": "https://easy2-code.github.io/Props-Practice-in-React",
"type": "module",
"scripts": {
"dev": "vite",
"build": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview",
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
}

🔹 4. Build the Project

Run this command inside in your project folder:

npm run build

This creates a `dist/` folder with the production build.

🔹 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run this command inside in your project folder:

npm run deploy

This will push the contents of the `dist/` folder to a branch called `gh-pages`.

🔹 6. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo on GitHub:
   👉 [Props-Practice-in-React Settings](https://github.com/easy2-code/Props-Practice-in-React/settings/pages)
2. Navigate to Settings → Pages
3. Under Source, select:

   - Branch: `gh-pages`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click Save

🔹 7. Access Your Live App

After a few minutes, your app will be available at:

👉 https://easy2-code.github.io/Props-Practice-in-React/ 🎉

✅ Notes

- If the page doesn’t load immediately, wait 2–5 minutes (GitHub Pages takes time).
- Clear browser cache if you see an old version.
- Always re-run:

  npm run build
  npm run deploy
