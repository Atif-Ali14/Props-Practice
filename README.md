React Props Practice:
Overview:

This project was developed as a practice exercise to strengthen understanding of React props and their role in building reusable and dynamic components. The focus was on creating modular components
passing data through props, and demonstrating variations in component rendering.


Objectives:

Learn how to pass and utilize props in React.

Create multiple reusable components that can adapt based on prop values.

Apply basic styling for a clean and structured user interface.

Deploy the project to GitHub Pages for live access.



Project Features:

Reusable Components


Button Component:

Accepts text and color as props.

Renders customizable buttons with styled backgrounds.


UserProfile Component:

Accepts name, age, and hobby as props.

Displays user details in a structured layout.


Card Component:

Accepts title and description as props.

Renders a card element containing content information.

Dynamic Rendering

Each component was displayed in multiple variations by modifying prop values.

Example:

Buttons: “Click Me” (blue), “Delete” (red), “Submit” (green)

User Profiles: Atif (22, Coding), Usman (23, Movie Directing), Aroona (22, Writing)

Cards: React Basics, Advanced React, Frontend Tools



Styling:

Clean, minimal CSS applied for consistent spacing, borders, and layout alignment.

Components styled for readability and presentation.



Code Structure:

Components stored in a dedicated components folder.

Code written with readability, modularity, and reusability in mind.



Technologies Used:

React (Vite) → for component-based UI development.

JavaScript (ES6+) → for logic implementation.

CSS → for styling and layout.

GitHub Pages → for deployment and hosting.



Deployment:
Steps Followed

Installed the gh-pages package.

Configured vite.config.js with the repository base path.

Added predeploy and deploy scripts to package.json.

Built the project with npm run build.

Deployed using npm run deploy, which published the production build to the gh-pages branch.

Configured GitHub Pages settings to serve the project from the gh-pages branch.


Key Learnings:

How props enable data-driven rendering in React.

Building modular components that adapt to different use cases.

Structuring React projects for clarity and maintainability.

Configuring and deploying React applications to GitHub Pages.
